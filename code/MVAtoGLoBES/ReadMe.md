This module converts the outputs from the MVA selection to GLoBES formatted inputs.

Usage for making full GLoBES configuration:
make_configs.py <path = directory with MVA trees> <label = directory name for output GLoBES configs>

Places full GLoBES configurations based on trees in <path> in lblpwgtools/inputs/MVAtoGLoBES/<label>/

TODO:

Add GLoBES smearing & efficiency plotting scripts.
