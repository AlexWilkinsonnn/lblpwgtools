This module converts the outputs from the MVA selection to GLoBES formatted inputs.

Usage for making full GLoBES configuration:
make_configs.py [PATH = directory with MVA trees] [LABEL = directory name for output GLoBES configs] [TYPE = 'mva' or 'cvn'] [SCALE = scale factor for reconstructed nue energy]

Places full GLoBES configurations based on trees in PATH in lblpwgtools/inputs/MVAtoGLoBES/LABEL/

TODO:

Add GLoBES smearing & efficiency plotting scripts.
